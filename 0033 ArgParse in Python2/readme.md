# ArgParse for Python 2.2
## (my attempt to write one)

* The codes here are written for Python 2.2 *

It's always convenient to control our applications behavior
via switch or command-line, that's why coming from Python 3
and then to Python 2 (2.2 exactly), I missed the ArgParse module.

You might say, "just download the source code and use it", right?
Well yeah, but:
- I don't want to convert the codes from Python3 to Python2
- I could learn a lot by trying to build a lite version from scratch

And who knows, maybe someone else would
find this useful too :)


** DISCLAIMER **
This does not attempt to recreate the full argparse module in Python 3
but simply provides enough functionality for most of my use cases.

Feel free to contribute if you want this to grow :)
